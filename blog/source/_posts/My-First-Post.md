Hello everyone! I hope I'll be able to give you some inspiration by these blog posts. Unfortunately, the marathon of life is indeed a run, and not a pleasure cruise. Especially the Christian life; I've been doing more reasoning, and the Christian lifestyle definitely comes with more challenges than the way of the world. However, I think the blessings God gives us in this life as the result of our lifestyle outweighs the extra challenges we have to face.

Life for anyone is a kind of race; it's facing continual discomfort and continual reasoning and decision-making. However, I think it's possible for everyone to get to the top; much of the Christian life is about helping others along when they start walking or going the wrong way. This DOES indeed cause you to go more slowly; but that's what the Christian life is all about - putting others before yourself. My journal from today was from the Bible In One Year plan:

"One who is righteous has many adversities, but the LORD rescues him from them all."
-Psalms 34:19, CSB

I hope this is an encouragement, because it means we are going to win the war and finish the race! Have a great weekend, and keep running strong, everyone!
